				Over the years, I've contributed to transformative projects at
				industry giants like Microsoft and agile startups like iFixit.
				At Microsoft, I played a key role in developing a virtualized
				satellite ground station, building robust distributed systems
				and ensuring top-notch cybersecurity for our critical workloads.
				At iFixit, I took ownership of projects that not only modernized
				e-commerce platforms but also streamlined operations across
				global retail and wholesale channels.

				My technical expertise spans a diverse range of languages and
				tools‚Äîproficient in Python, Java, C#, SQL, and more‚Äîand I excel
				in leveraging modern cloud technologies such as Kubernetes,
				Helm, and infrastructure-as-code to create scalable, secure
				solutions. Whether it's working on cutting-edge cloud
				deployments or leading cross-functional teams to meet
				challenging goals, I'm driven by the thrill of solving complex
				problems and delivering impactful results.
